The nyquist svgs are the PCB outlines. I included them because they could be helpful if you want a case where the pcb screws into a plate above or below.

Nyquist has 5 rows but the PCB outlines show that you can "break off" the bottom row; I'm sure you could edit the SVG or if you print this on paper, you can cut off that bottom row if you need to trace this onto a material, etc.
